NOTE: see bottom of this file for suggested configurations on particular ANL
machines.

0 - Checkout, build, and install the trunk version of ROSS

    mkdir ross
    cd ross
    svn co https://subversion.cs.rpi.edu/svn/rossnet/trunk
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ARCH=x86_64 CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ../trunk
    make -j 3
    make install

    <the result should be that the trunk version of ROSS is installed in the 
    ross/install/ directory>

1 - If this is the first time you are building codes-base, run

    ./prepare.sh

2- Configure codes-base. This can be done in the source directory or in a
   dedicated build directory if you prefer out-of-tree builds.  The CC
   environment variable must refer to an MPI compiler.

    ./configure --with-ross=/path/to/ross/install --prefix=/path/to/codes-base/install CC=mpicc

3 - Build codes-base

    make clean && make && make install

4 - codes-base uses flex and bison (or lex and yacc) to generate several parsers.
These tools auto-generate C source files. To remove all of the autogenerated
files for these parsers, execute

    make maintainer-clean-local


Machine-specific configurations:
----------------

- Fusion (ANL): add the following keys to your ~/.soft file and run "resoft"
  prior to following the steps described in this file:

  +python-2.7.3
  +autoconf-2.68
  +git
  +cmake
