1- Torus network model:

- Check how to specify the buffer size in the config file (buffer size is in flits)--- Option 1 specify the buffer size in packets and convert it into flits?
- Check how to specify the number of torus nodes from the config file? Currently they are being calculated from the file... How to integrate this with the mapping thing?
Option: Specify the torus network and the length of each torus dimension.
