[Notes from Xu Yang]

To generate the allocation file:

python listgen.py config_alloc.conf

There are three lines in the config_alloc.conf file. 
1st line: allocation policy, you can use CONT, rand, stripe etc.
2nd line: the total terminal number of nodes in the system, if you use 8-router
dragonfly, this number would be 1056
3rd line: the number of ranks of each application. 

To generate multiple random allocations with the same network configuration,
listgen-upd.py can be used (Works only for random allocations right now). The
configuration file (Example in config_alloc-upd) will then look like: 

1st line: allocation policy, must be rand
2nd line: the total terminal number of nodes in the system
3rd line: the number of random allocations to generate
4th line: number of ranks for each application.
