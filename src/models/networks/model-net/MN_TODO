1- Torus model integration, possible additions:
- Allow some compute nodes to be idle (not mapped to a server) i.e. we can specify any number of server and torus nodes that we want in the config file. 
The torus configuration parameters should set an upper bound on the number of servers/compute nodes.
- Change the buffer overflow message? May be allow a slowed down packet injection rate if the buffer overflows and report the average injection rate at the
end of the simulation.

2- Mapping:
- Update the mapping code to handle remainder (where number of ROSS LPs are not evenly divisible by the number of PEs).
- Modify the get_lp_info function to return the LP count of the given LP? Can help with local lp count calculation.
- Remove the group id and type id arguments from get_lp_info function.

Make the model-net test case running for two different types of networks?
- Use the I/O activity trace logs from BG/Q and BG/P for I/O modelling.
