- Generalize the notation used to identify entities in the application (they
  are referred to by ranks right now).  See email from Dries 9/18/2013.

- Implement some "real" workload generator method examples.

- Plug workload API into storage simulations.

- Implement a trace replay tool as an MPI program that uses the same API so
  that we can replay workloads on real systems in addition to simulation.
