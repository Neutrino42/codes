0 - Install codes-base, either from the repository or using the 0.3.0 release
    tarball (see http://www.mcs.anl.gov/projects/codes/).

1 - If you are building codes-net directly from the repository, run

    ./prepare.sh

2 - Configure codes-net. This can be done in the source directory or in a
    dedicated build directory if you prefer out-of-tree builds.  The CC
    environment variable must refer to an MPI compiler.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure --with-codes-base=/path/to/codes-base/install --prefix=/path/to/codes-net/install CC=mpicc

3 - Build codes-net

    make && make install
4 - (optional) run test programs

    make tests && make check
